# Cellular Automaton
###### Brahm Capoor

This is a simple Cellular Automation, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk) by funfunfunction. After seeing it made in Javascript, I didn't think it was very fair to use Javascript, so I used Python instead.

### Details
* Uses numpy matrices to represent the state of the automaton's spacetime
* Uses matplotlib to plot and animate the automaton
